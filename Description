"ChatRooms" is a web application which allows its users to have group chats.
Every user after typing his name has an opportunity to either join or create a chat room and
communicate with other members. Rooms are identified by their names, so either you are creating or
joining you have to know the name. Users are differentiated by their names as well. Considering this behaviour,
you cannot create two rooms with the same name, or join a non-existent room, or have the same name with other user.
To prevent such occasions, corresponding checks and alerts were provided. Also, some basic user validation
such as non-empty fields or forbidden characters in names was also added.
While you actually chatting with others in your room you can send messages, leave the room and
see a list of active users. In addition to ordinary messages, you can see join/leave statements when someone
else join or leaves respectively and newcomers can see a chat story (last 20 messages).
